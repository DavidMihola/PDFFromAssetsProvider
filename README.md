=====================

An Android ContentProvider that makes PDFs from the assets folder accessible to other apps

This repository contains a working example of an Android app that makes a PDF from the asset folder available via a ContentProvider.

The different versions of this ContentProvider are based an various tutorials, most importantly:
* http://stackoverflow.com/a/19819321
* http://www.vogella.com/code/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/content/FileProvider.html

This project mainly serves the purpose of bringing these tutorials together in a minimal, but working, example app.
